# NBA-Game-Prediction


This project is my attempt to build a predictive model for NBA games. The model uses various game statistics to predict future game outcomes. The project consists of data collection via web scraping, data cleaning and exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

The project is based on the work of Vik Paruchuri, a Data Science teacher from Dataquest. His original work inspired me and provided a solid base to kick-start my project.

The initial code and the idea for this project are inspired by the video tutorials by Vik Paruchuri. I am grateful to him for sharing his knowledge and making his work public, which greatly helped me to learn and develop my skills in this field. His work served as a foundation upon which I was able to build and optimize my own model.
